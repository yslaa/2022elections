              <h2>#1. Jose "LITO" Atienza Jr.</h2>
              <p class="iskrol">
                Lito Atienza, 80, has represented the Buhay party-list as a lawmaker in the lower house since 2012.
                <br><br>
                He has held several seats in the City of Manila since the 1970s, ultimately becoming mayor for three
                consecutive years from 1998 to 2007. His appointment as Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources
                under the Arroyo administration from 2007 to 2009 also drew criticism from environmentalists who
                disapproved of his anti-conservation record as mayor.
                <br><br>
                As Buhay representative, Atienza opposes divorce, same-sex marriage or civil unions and the death
                penalty. He has also sought to repeal the Reproductive Health Law, claiming that the law’s promotion of
                birth control and use of artificial contraceptives and the possible legalization of same-sex marriage
                through the anti-discrimination provision violate the 1987 Constitution.
                <br><br>
                In contrast to his religious beliefs and what he calls his "pro-life" advocacy, Atienza urged his
                colleagues in the House of Representatives to declare their full support for President Rodrigo Duterte’s
                bloody campaign against illegal drugs in November 2019.
                <br><br>
                Atienza had intended to retire from politics and serve as an advisor to Senator Manny Pacquiao on his
                campaign but was convinced by the boxer-turned-lawmaker to seek the vice presidency as his running mate.
                He is campaigning on a platform of good government and the elimination of corruption to provide a better
                life for Filipinos, listing 22 high-level agenda items to be tackled in a Pacquiao-Atienza
                administration. He claims that he may step aside if he is elected vice president but Pacquiao loses as
                president, insisting that the boxing icon is the best choice for the position.
                <br><br>
                His father Jose Atienza Sr. served under three Philippine presidents and founded the Liberal Party.

              <h2>#2. Walden "WALDEN" Bello</h2>
              <p class="iskrol">
                Walden Bello, 76, has been an activist, social worker, academic and political analyst since the mid-70s.
                He ran for senator in the 2016 elections as an independent but failed to secure a seat, placing 36th
                with just 2.41% of the total votes.
                <br><br>
                Prior to that, he served as a representative of the Akbayan Citizens’ Action Party from 2009 to 2015.
                His second term was cut short when he resigned on Mar. 19, 2015, due to “irreconcilable differences"
                over the party’s support for the Aquino administration, citing President Benigno Aquino’s refusal to
                accept command responsibility for the Mamasapano clash.
                <br><br>
                Bello is a doctor of sociology which he teaches along with public administration at the University of
                the Philippines Diliman. He is also an international adjunct professor of sociology at Binghamton
                University, a top public school in New York State, US.
                <br><br>
                As an active member of the anti-Marcos movement, Bello was arrested multiple times during protests at
                the height of the Martial Law era in 1978. He was credited for breaking into the World Bank headquarters
                and stealing 3,000 pages of confidential documents that he said would show the connection between the
                International Monetary Fund and World Bank to the late ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He later wrote
                an account of the documents entitled Development Debacle: the World Bank in the Philippines in 1982. He
                went on to campaign for and write extensively on the alternative models of development, environmentalism
                and demilitarization.
                <br><br>
                After the Laban ng Masa coalition launched a 300,000 signature campaign to urge Bello to run for
                president in 2022, he eventually agreed to be Leody de Guzman’s running mate. As a tandem, De Guzman and
                Bello propose to “demilitarize society, uphold human rights and punish mass-murderers and plunderers."
                Bello claims that their platform offers the kinds of reforms capable of stopping what he calls the
                “Marcos-Duterte axis of evil”. <a href="https://votepilipinas.com/candidate/walden-bello.html"

              <h2>#3. Jose Rizalito "LITO" David</h2>
              <p class="iskrol">
                Rizalito David, 60, is a pro-life advocate and perennial candidate for public office.
                <br><br>
                A near-constant presence in previous elections, he filed two unsuccessful petitions to disqualify
                Senator Grace Poe and then-Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte from the presidential race in 2016. This was
                after he was declared a nuisance candidate for the same race.
                <br><br>
                David also made failed bids for the Senate in 2010 and 2013, campaigning on his experience as a
                legislative staff member and political consultant.
                <br><br>
                He has long-espoused stances which he says are guided by his Catholic faith, including opposition to
                what he claims are the “anti-life” provisions of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act
                of 2012, same-sex marriage, abortion and divorce.
                <br><br>
                In 2022, David is running for vice president on a platform of centering faith in the formation of
                policies, restoration of confidence in government, and cultural revival. He is also advancing his tandem
                with Jose Montemayor as a supposed alternative to the political control of oligarchical families in the
                country, to combat the amorality and cynicism of the general public and promote faith restoration.
                <br><br>
                Although he vows a science-based approach to the pandemic, David himself claims that the COVID-19
                vaccine somehow differs from older vaccines since the former are authorized only for emergency use in
                the Philippines. In particular, he maintains that the long-term consequences of the vaccines using
                messenger RNA are still unknown despite the World Health Organization repeatedly confirming that mRNA
                vaccine technology has been studied for over a decade.
                <br><br>
                The WHO maintains that mRNA vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety and clinical trials have
                shown that they provide a long-lasting immune response. Further, mRNA vaccines are not live virus
                vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA.
                <br><br>
                David also opposes mandatory vaccination against COVID-19, citing his belief in each person’s right to
                informed consent. <a href="https://votepilipinas.com/candidate/david-rizalito.html"

              <h2>#4. Sara "INDAY SARA" Duterte - Carpio</h2>
              <p class="iskrol">
                Sara Duterte, 43, is the incumbent mayor of Davao City. She became the city's first female mayor and the
                youngest to ever be elected in its history. She is the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte who also
                served as mayor of the southern city for several terms before seeking the country's highest office.
                <br><br>
                Duterte is the running-mate of Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., a former senator who is also the son and
                namesake of the late ousted dictator. She entered the vice presidential race at the last hour via
                substitution after initially claiming that she had no interest in seeking a national post.
                <br><br>
                Her younger brother, Davao City Vice Mayor Sebastian “Baste” Duterte withdrew his bid for reelection and
                substituted into the Davao City mayoral race. Their brother, Paolo Duterte, has retained his candidacy
                for reelection as representative of the 1st District of Davao City.
                <br><br>
                Mayor Duterte is running on shifting the system of government to federalism to veer away from what she
                derides as "imperial Manila," a hark back to her father's own campaign rhetoric. Her last-minute
                substitution into a national race is also reminiscent of her father's own run.
                <br><br>
                The Marcos-Duterte tandem is formally backed by several other heavyweight political clans including
                those led by former Presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Joseph Estrada.<a

              <p class="iskrol">
                Manny SD Lopez is an economist and management professional touting decades of local and international
                experience. He headed Empowered People’s Initiative and Reform Movement Alliance or ePIRMa, which
                advocated for people’s initiative as a means of charter change, and the 2.22 Coalition, which sought
                government reforms and the mass resignation of top officials in favor of a “transition government”
                during the administration of President Benigno Aquino III.
                <br><br>
                Lopez said that he was prompted to run at the urging of the Workers and Peasants Party's late chairman,
                Jose Malvar Villegas. He is campaigning on a platform of boosting economic recovery through lending and
                direct investments, reform of the people’s initiative mechanism and improving government efficiency and
                competency as an anti-corruption measure.
                <br><br>
                If elected, Lopez says he would seek either the foreign affairs or trade and industry post, to help the

              <p class="iskrol">
                Doc Willie Ong, 58, is an internal medicine specialist, cardiologist, author and medical commentator who
                gained popularity primarily through social media where he offers medical and healthcare-related advice.
                <br> <br>
                Ong also briefly served as a Department of Health consultant. He left ABS-CBN’s Salamat Doc in 2018 to
                run for the Senate, running a campaign backed by his substantial online presence and strong support from
                migrant Filipino workers. For a neophyte candidate, Ong placed a surprisingly high 18th place in the
                polls with 7.6 million votes.
                <br> <br>
                He has been supportive of the COVID-19 vaccines’ efficacy, a contrast to his vocal opposition to the
                dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. The involvement of high-profile figures like Ong in the propagation of
                unsubstantiated stories about the Dengvaxia controversy may have caused vaccine hesitancy during that
                period that stretches on until the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to critics. Ong maintains
                his stance that there is no conflict between his beliefs, arguing that Dengvaxia is different from the
                COVID-19 vaccines.
                <br> <br>
                Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso chose Ong as running mate in the 2022 elections for his medical
                background and expertise. Ong is advocating for health system reform, including improved support for

              <p class="iskrol">
                Kiko Pangilinan, 58, is an incumbent senator and the president of the once-ruling Liberal Party.
                <br><br>
                Prior to his marriage to actress Sharon Cuneta in 1996 and his election to the Senate in 2001, he gained
                fame as a legal commentator in various mass media programs. Pangilinan has served three terms as
                senator, briefly interrupted by his appointment as food security czar from 2014 to 2015.
                <br><br>
                As chairman of the Senate Agriculture and Food Committee he pushed for the support of the agricultural
                and fisheries sector, particularly in the 18th Congress. He also currently sits as chairman of the
                Senate panel on constitutional amendments.
                <br><br>
                Pangilinan was the lone negative vote on Senate Bill 1564, which was passed as Republic Act No. 11494,
                or Bayanihan II, which allocates a P140 billion standby fund for a variety of recovery programs to
                mitigate the effects of the pandemic. He cited the alleged misuse of the funds appropriated under R.A.
                11469, or Bayanihan I, and the failed efforts to curb the spread of infections despite severe mitigation
                measures imposed on the Filipino people.
                <br><br>
                He is also one of two senators who voted against the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of
                2020.
                <br><br>
                Pangilinan decided to forego his Senate reelection bid to run alongside Vice President Leni Robredo who
                is seeking the presidency in 2022 as an independent candidate. He is campaigning on ensuring food
                security, managing the pandemic and addressing corruption. <a

              <h2>#9. Vicente "TITO" Sotto III</h2>
              <p class="iskrol">
                Tito Sotto, 73, the incumbent Senate president, has served in Congress for almost two decades and has
                authored over 100 laws.
                <br> <br>
                He has often been tagged as a conservative lawmaker, largely because he continues to block the passage
                of the SOGIE Equality Bill in the Senate, claiming that some of its provisions trample on religious and
                academic freedom as well as women’s rights.
                <br> <br>
                He also opposed the Reproductive Health Law when it was still being debated in the upper chamber but has
                since clarified that he has no issue with the enacted law which, unlike the Senate bill, does not permit
                abortion, population control and abortifacients.
                <br> <br>
                Although Sotto, along with his running-mate Sen. Panfilo Lacson, is running as an alternative to the
                Duterte administration who will restore trust in the government, the Senate under his leadership has
                generally legislated according to the incumbent president’s agenda.
                <br> <br>
                Sotto is the principal author of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 and has long supported the
                administration’s bloody campaign against illegal drugs which he vows to improve by employing a “holistic
                approach” if elected.
                <br> <br>
                Several other members of Sotto's family are making bids for public office. His son Gian Sotto and his
                nephew Vico Sotto are both seeking reelection as vice mayor of Quezon City and mayor of Pasig CIty,
                respectively. Nina Sotto, the Senate president's niece-in-law, is running to replace her husband Wahoo
                Sotto as Parañaque 2nd District councilor.
